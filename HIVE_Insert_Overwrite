Use Case: Creating the ETL LOAD CYCLE table in HIVE and performing the insert overwrite operations to update the status of the load. 

Description : In traditional RDBMS managing the ETL load is not a big challenge. In hadoop hive we have developed one such a process where
              the ETL_LOAD_CYCLE table is used to switch the status of load from TBD > In-Progress >> Complete. With this code our attempt
              is to bring power in HIVE ecosystem in order to manage the loads effectively. There are much other better ways but this can be
              used based on the need.
